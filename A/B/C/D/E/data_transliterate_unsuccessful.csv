Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,Overall Superb performance.<br> Fact is it shouldn&#39;t happen in real life.,[]
Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,"We get one attempt to be happy in life. In the process, there is a high probability that we will not marry the love of our life.... our soul mate. However, I have lived in the west and I agree with their thinking that one needs to walkout of toxic relationships (even if means a marriage) since there is no point living with a person that you don&#39;t love from your soul. It is a waste of valuable life. Children should not be an obstacle for someone&#39;s happiness, cause they will leave you anyways and thereafter high probability that they will not even bother to appreciate the sacrifices parents have made all their lives.",[]
Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,"Each and Everytime you Enjoy this experience. That third party (leagal marriage)suffer a lot. Hence you are rude than devil.

Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,"According to christianity : Marriage is some thing pre planed by god , it shall be as per gods plan . Typical point here is the marriage or sexual intimation shall not be managed as per humen wish but as per the constitutional system that god has given when he was creating the living beings. God made the world orderly but later all collapsed due to the sin committed by eve by listening to serpant voice of satan. Satan created an idea in humen to think that humens can be like god or can live with out god or his guidance. <br><br>christian marriage principles:<br><br>Matthew 19:9 ESV / 457 helpful votes <br>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”<br><br>01. Looking a person lust fully is adulatory and its sinful.<br><br>02. Marrying a person who not obeying God and not living in the way god thought shall lead to critical issues.<br><br>03. Let men not divide what god has united together ( This means even husband and wife doesn&#39;t have the right to break the covenant made between them in front of god because its gods will to unite them ) <br><br>04. Husband must love their wives just as Jesus love the church and wives should submit to their husbands ( This means husband will lead the house in a godly way and wife will support for that but both are equal in front of god ) <br><br>05. So loving each other is not a choice its gods order, The husband and wife will become as one flesh for their entire life .<br><br>06. You are marrying to glorify god and to preach the gospel to people and to serve to god together .<br><br>07. Marriage is not about your own pleasure , its about loving your partner and caring about your partner.<br><br>psychological<br><br>09. Your every actions must glorify god.<br><br>adulatory<br><br>11. marriage is only between one men and one women. <br><br>12. Only when your partner has dead you are free to marry another person. ( Divorce is sinfull)<br><br>Adulatory<br><br>14. Fornication is sinfull.<br><br>15. Lusting in another one is sinfull.<br><br>Hebrews 13:4 ESV / 2,223 helpful votes <br>Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.<br><br>Genesis 2:24 ESV / 2,433 helpful votes Helpful Not Helpful <br>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<br><br>Matthew 19:2-9 ESV / 861 helpful votes <br>And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one&#39;s wife for any cause?” He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” ...<br><br>Genesis 2:18 ESV / 726 helpful votes <br>Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”<br><br>Ephesians 5:22-33 ESV / 1,687 helpful votes <br>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, ...<br><br>GOD THE ALL MIGHTY FATHER AND JESUS THE MESSIAH BLESS YOU ALL<br>AND GOD BLES SRILANKA .",[]

And if i ever be strong and lucky to look at your eyes again, im afraid they would have forgotten to talk with eachother by then! And you would be talking with someone else. 💔 I miss u so much and it&#39;s terrible when i miss you. I&#39;m just writing nonsense here, cz i can no longer talk with you ❣️ i miss us so much. I miss our conversations. Specially the late night ones. I miss our friendship. Be safe, happy and healthy my dearest. I&#39;ll always wish the best for u, except when it comes to finding a life partner. Cz u taught me its ok to be selfish, so here&#39;s im being selfish. Thoughts about u still hurt the same as it used to. Or maybe even more? You said it would get better. You wouldn&#39;t lie to me r8? I&#39;d be okay someday r8? 💐",[]

Abisheka and Mihdu,Dannawada Adare Neethiya,"murder case of Padmini Kularathne is another mysterious case that was given the chance to nature for the purpose of giving a verdict after the Supreme Court judgment.<br><br>Concerning the facts of the case, Kularatne, a well-known doctor, was the heir to the Samudrasiri House built in the ancient Dutch style.<br><br>After his death, his son doctor Demand Gamini De Silva Kularatne owned the “Samudrasiri” House.<br><br>Doctor Gamini Kularatne (first accused), his mother Laura Kularatne (second accused), servants called Sophia (third accused), Ceciline (these two were the kitchen workers), Rommel the driver and another servant called Banda lived in this house.<br><br>Doctor Gamini Kularatne had been working as a Government doctor at the Kekirawa Hospital for some time.<br><br>He was married on September 28, 1947, to Padmini Susila Perera, 23 years old, who inherited a large estate. Later after the marriage, she was named Padmini Kularatne. The couple got married and settled in the “Samudrasiri” house and lived happily for several years.<br><br>After the third child, doctor Kularatne quit his Government job and started a private dispensary in Galle. Ariyawathi, a beautiful young woman, was selected as his assistant against the wishes of his wife.<br><br>In time, he had an affair with Ariyawathi. Later, Padmini Kularatne caught him when he was in close contact with this lady in the dispensary.<br><br>This was not a good time and there were frequent misunderstandings between these spouses.<br><br>Laura, the mother-in-law of Padmini Kularatne, also disliked her and took doctor Kularatne’s side and discriminated against her at every turn.<br><br>In a very short time, he tried to get her admitted to the Angoda hospital saying that she had a mental illness but it was prevented due to her sister “Lalani”.<br><br>He once even beat her with a whip and his mother Laura locked her in a dark room upstairs and fed her from a window downstairs with the help of a rope.<br><br>During this period he offered her fifty thousand rupees and asked for a divorce but she refused. However, with time she lingered with such stress.<br><br>Wicker basket<br><br>On April, 9, 1967, shortly after taking the food sent upstairs in the wicker basket as before, she began to go to the toilet incessantly with severe abdominal pain, so she fell unconscious on the bed. She later informed her sister, saying, “I’m having a hard time and if you admit me to the hospital I can save myself.”<br><br>When Lalini arrived at the scene with police officers, Padmini Kularatne had gone on her final journey.<br><br>The post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr. H. V. J. Fernando, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Ceylon.<br><br>He got samples of her vomit and her stomach for the examination.<br><br>It was later proved that the cause of death of Padmini Kularatne was a toxic chemical (Potassium Arsenic [K3As]) and contained 730mg. He suspected that the poison had been introduced into a “billing pickle” she had eaten at the time. It was suspected that it was Sophia cooked the poisonous food and that her mother-in-law and husband were behind it.<br><br>Police arrested her husband, mother-in-law, and servant Sophia on suspicion of aiding and abetting murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and committing murder, and the case was heard before an English-speaking jury. All three accused were sentenced to death after the trial at High Court.<br><br>Court of Appeal<br><br>Later, Attorney-at-law Colvin R. de Silva with several other lawyers appeared for the accused.<br><br>The following matters were considered at the hearing of the appeal filed before the Court of Appeal.<br><br>Lack of any eye-witness evidence, the prosecution did not call for evidence, although it is suspected that the servant Ceciline prepared the food with the toxic chemical.<br><br>There was no evidence of intent against Ceciline, and at the same time there was no evidence that she had no such intention.<br><br>Contradictions in the testimony of a girl named Achini, the youngest daughter of Padmini Kularatne, and inability to accept some of that testimony’s evidence.<br><br>The identities of the findings in a criminal case must be accurate not by assumptions, but by direct evidence that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. During the trial, the analyst presented Padmini’s plate from what she used to eat to the medical examiner but did not call the Police Constable or the Inspector who brought the plate to her or Achini to identify the plate.<br><br>Bottles of arsenic<br><br>The two bottles of arsenic used for medicines found in a cupboard in doctor Kularatne’s dispensary could have misled the jury that the potassium arsenic in Padmini Kularatne’s stomach was the same.<br><br>Did the judge have examine that there is sufficient evidence or is the evidence reasonable, credible, conclusive, or in other words, a question of the veracity of the evidence.<br><br>In accordance with Section 230 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which states that it is the duty of a judge to decide whether there is evidence to support the defendant’s case.<br><br>The jury must decide whether such evidence and conviction has been substantiated.<br><br>Therefore, failure to inform the Jury that the murder may have been a suicide, despite the fact that all possible facts must be pointed out to the jurors.<br><br>A statement made during an inquiry under Section 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be used only for the limited purposes permitted by that division.<br><br>It cannot be used to form a basis for speculating that the behaviour of the person who created it is suspicious.<br><br>Prior to amending the charge sheet, security points should be made, especially at a late stage. If the amendment is made before the judge decides whether or not to proceed with the proceedings immediately in accordance with Section 172 or 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendant should be consulted but that was not the case.<br><br>After considering the above main points, the Court of Appeal unanimously held that the errors in the judicial procedure and the facts presented before the jury were far less than the evidence that could be presented by a fair Jury.<br><br>Accordingly, they were of the opinion that they could not support the Jury’s decision in considering the evidence and facts.<br><br>The accused were acquitted of all charges.<br><br>Today, the ground floor of the “Samudrasiri” house is a tourist hotel and the upper floor is an office of the Department of Labor.<br><br>Was Padmini Kularatne poisoned and killed? Or did she commit suicide because she could not bear the mental pressure? It is still a mystery.",[]

Sarith and Surith,Salli Salli,"This might not be a comment, but a kind of letter. When I first heard a part of the song, I thought who is the lyricist. And I found out later. This is great. Although I can&#39;t describe the music theoretically, as a listener, I feel that everything is mixed very well. Tabla, bass guitar, rap part, all these. Again, I have no theoretical knowledge of music. But I think that everyone in the band gives amazing support in a creation.<br><br>Also, When I saw Sarith&#39;s name as the costume designer, I felt even more proud thinking how multi-talented our generation is. I wanted to leave such a long comment because I really felt every part of this song.<br><br>Finally, Really love your new change. This kind of contrast between so many similar love songs is really worth it. As a big fan of yours, I think this style suits you very well. Even legendary bands like Gypsies and Marians and contemporary bands like wayo Daddy had made their image throughout different creations like these. That&#39;s a truth You have already created a unique identity for yourself, but I think if you deviate from common topics and do different creations like this, that uniqueness will be strengthened.<br><br>So, wish you all the best for becoming the legendary band of our generation! All the best NEWS❤",[]

Listening to it, this rhythm makes me dance and smile, even I don&#39;t understand what the lyrics say.🙈 My mind just goes back in time to that old song “Oh Carol” by Neil Sedaka. But the timing &amp; the rhythm of &quot;Unmada Prema Geeya&quot; is closer to “Oh Carol” from the last decade, sung by General Saint and Don Campbell - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCR6KsuVGcI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCR6KsuVGcI</a> 💃🕺 You all guys together with Yohani have done great work. 👍 I&#39;m in love with this dance and song.

Every artist is the same nowadays when it comes to music videos; there&#39;s atleast 1 sexual reference. I mean look at this, its explicit. Iraj&#39;s videos aren&#39;t that explicit...it does sexualize women or whatever but you can&#39;t possibly put the blame on him or his team or the actors for ruining the music industry in Sri Lanka. It&#39;s a matter of accepting the artist, not the concept these days.

Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,@Waru T see your making the same point what i have made. Can i ask who you are to judge my perception towards this issue? My stand is different to yours yet you call me judgmental. So if someone outside the marriage laid with your spouse or imaging if your father sleep&#39;s with another women and dishonest to your mother would you still tell your mother don&#39;t be judgmental it&#39;s just love it can happen anywhere any time father you go ahead. Free mindset that&#39;s utter bullshit.,[]
Thisara Weerasinghe,Ansathu Oba,"@Eshan Perera whom are you to decide what&#39;s is wrong and what is correct, anyone can falling in love at anytime , if someone finds it something to be appreciated, that&#39;s someone&#39;s wish <br>You hv no right to stop it<br>I am just a human with a very clear mindset anyways where I am from or what I do do not define me <br>Stop being judgemental and just keep quiet if u don&#39;t understand it",[]

BnS,Unmada Prema Geeya,"No wonder SL took so long to even have a protest like this. They only think about them, and if you have everything then why bother to fight for others right? . B and s supporters seems to be either all in high class society, or people who spends their parents money to go and enjoy the their expensive shows, if not why not support the people who could not work in their IT jobs and other jobs while the power cuts were on. Everyone does not have generators. Most probably B and S have all the luxury so they don&#39;t see how the middle class have to be in long lineups for gas and have to suffer during power cuts. If you don&#39;t like the protest then you too must be someone who has everything you want in life or in a cheaters club. When the medicine run out, may be you will see it differently if one of your loved ones has to suffer without medicine. I sincerely hope it won&#39;t happen though. Or may be you have money to take them to another country for treatment...",[]
BnS,Unmada Prema Geeya,"What they are saying us that they don&#39;t get caught to all the lies anymore it is good that they had the guts to show that Sri Lankans can not be fooled by the politicians. The govt might not change but now they will have to rethink about how they have to do their work. All these years every one was quite, as long as their needs are met, they just pretend that these things won&#39;t happen I know there is no clear answer to the present situation, but they are showing the govt can not fool people anymore. I think all should encourage these people so that govt and govt employees do their work without expecting the people to give bribes fir every signature they want or anything which has to get their approvals",[]

I still crave myself with flowers. I still screamed in my imagination. I cracked my lips and laced my loneliness. I was left waiting for you.

Sanuka Wick,Saragaye,The art you made by your fingernails on my back.....<br>These memories on the bed yesterday .....<br>With so much love......<br>I got freshened by the morning bliss and i am still finding your name on those shapes you engraved by your nails on my back.....<br>I&#39;m still alone covering with the blanket made by moonlight.<br>Sex on the night.....then you made a blank on my heart... now i am alone in the morning.,[]
Sanuka Wick,Saragaye,@R 7777 that&#39;s pretty good translation i guess. Usually sanuka&#39;s songs are hard to translate. You really can&#39;t get the real feeling unless you speak sinhala. Simple words but we can dive into find a deeper meaning. You did pretty well. I think you should post the meaning as a comment to the video so that others can get an idea too.,[]

Ridma,Sobana,"@Nauchelli Fernando If you can&#39;t appreciate it, try to be at least decent enough to ignore it and leave. These artists put lots of hard work and effort to produce this kind of output, so be respectful to that and be a part of good mankind.
